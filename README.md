## Data

* We have utilized TensorFlow Speech Commands Data Sets [^fn3] containing 65000, 30 second long speech signals as a training sample.

* We have utilized 150,000 samples of test data, available in the [Kaggle Challenge] to test our model accuracy.

## Final Model / Analysis

We have used LSTM + CNN model

TBD
